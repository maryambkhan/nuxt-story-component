## Maryam Khan

### Code Journal

- I created three components navigation-bar,post and footer used tailwindcss.
- I had problem with rendring components it took me while i had to start over
  but finaly figured it out i was missing ~component in my nuxt.confing
- Then i started working on it again and started styling it and last thing i did was added  image and i broke my server i was following nuxt docs mostly still broke it
- I asked jessica she told me i had images in wrong folder so i fixed that
- after working in nuxt i found how my schemas were wrong and how should i fix them i tried 
 to fix it still somethings dont look good i think

-  It was interesting experience working with nuxt and vue.js. I was okay working 
 with only storyblok but using them together it took me while to understand had lots of questions 
 solved during this assignment some left hoping i figuer that out in next assignment.
