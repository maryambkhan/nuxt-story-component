        Animation is a method in which figures are manipulated to appear as
        moving images. In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by
        hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on
        film. Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery
        (CGI). Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D
        computer animation (which may have the look of traditional animation)
        can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster real-time
        renderings.
