    <p class="mt-2">
      Hundreds of years before the introduction of true animation, people all
      over the world enjoyed shows with moving figures that were created and
      manipulated manually in puppetry, automata, shadow play, and the magic
      lantern. The multi-media phantasmagoria shows that were very popular in
      European theatres from the late 18th century through the first half of the
      19th century, featured lifelike projections of moving ghosts and other
      frightful imagery in motion.

    <p class="mt-2">
      When cinematography eventually broke through in 1895 after animated
      pictures had been known for decades, the wonder of the realistic details
      in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment. Animation on
      film was not commercialized until a few years later by manufacturers of
      optical toys, with chromolithography film loops (often traced from
      live-action footage) for adapted toy magic lanterns intended for kids to
      use at home. It would take some more years before animation reached movie
      theaters.
